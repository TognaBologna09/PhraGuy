3d Physics-movement gameplay with procedurally animated character

## Background
This was a side project attempted by myself and a friend that took place over 6 weeks. The goal was to create a 3D multiplayer racing game where players run, jump, and swing through an obstacle course competing for first place. As we began to implement features, development began to stall we halted the project for a few reasons: we were a 2-person team, neither of us had experience developing multiplayer games, nor were we proficient digital artists. We concluded that we had slim chances of creating a successful game of this scale given our current level of experience and halted development.
